# 🕹️ Powerline.io Monitor

This project is a Go-based monitor for the browser game **Powerline.io**. It connects to the game servers, fetches room info, and interacts with WebSocket servers to monitor server stats and leaderboards across different regions. This data can be sent across webhooks through platforms like discord.

## 🚀 Features

- 🌍 Monitor multiple regions: Europe, America, Asia.
- 📡 Fetch live room and leaderboard information.
- 🔔 Discord webhook for real-time notifications.
- ⏱️ Custom WebSocket timeouts and error handling.

## ✅ To-Do List

- [ ] **Dynamic Ports**: Add better port handling instead of hardcoding.
- [ ] **Player Count**: Add logic to get the real player count.
- [ ] **Live Streams**: Add links to livestreams of each region that can be played back.
